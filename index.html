            I am a Manchester-based full stack junior developer, currently
            undertaking the Developer Pathway at Northcoders. I am due to
            graduate on 9 August 2019. Following my previous career in the legal
            profession, I have strong analytical and inter-personal skills.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whilst the course at Northcoders focussed on JavaScript, I am
            comfortable learning new concepts, libraries and languages. During
            the project phase of the Developer Pathway, I worked as part of a
            5-person team to deliver a full-stack application in a two-week
            period. This was a Progressive Web App named Misplaced Mcr, designed
            to reunite lost items with their owners.
            <br />

            Please feel free to peruse the various projects below to see my other work.

            <h3>Northcoder News</h3>
            <p>
              Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, rating and
              discussion website for accessing and contributing to the latest
              developments. The project was built using React. Each article on
              Northcoders News is divided into a particular topic. Each article
              has a user-driven rating system, which can be provided with up or
              down votes using the back-end API. Users may add comments to an
              article, which may also be voted up or down. Users may add
              additional articles to the website, selecting from existing
              topics. The website also offers functionality to add any topic of
              the user's choosing, after which articles may be added under that
              topic.
              <br /><br />
              This is a two-part project, consisting of both back-end API and
              front-end elements.The backend was constructed using full TDD,
              utilising mocha, chai and supertest. The API is hosted on Heroku
              and is available
              <a href="http://nc-news-james.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. The
              repository is available
              <a href="https://github.com/jameswmoar/be-nc-news"> here</a>.

            <h3>Roast Dinner Timings Generator</h3>
            <p>
              A small app that can be used to generate the timings for cooking a
              roast dinner. Simply enter the meat, its weight and the time you
              wish to eat. All the timings will be generated for you, allowing a
              stress-free roast experience.

            <h3>The Wolf of Paternoster Square</h3>
            <p>
              A game that attempts (to an uncertain degree of accuracy) to simulate the intricacies of the stock
              market. The player starts with Â£1,000.00 and attempts to make as
              much money as possible, whilst the market goes about its own
              business. The player can make initial purchases without pressure,
              but upon clicking "Enter the trading floor", the market opens and
              will fluctuate depending on the outcome of random number
              generation. The player must attempt to keep up with the movements
              of the market, whilst hoping to avoid the consequences of a market
              correction!

              <br /><br />
              Play the game
